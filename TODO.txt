(1) Best to just finish notebook pipeline first maybe.


(2) Need to figure out layout.csv and uvbeam.yaml files in sim_files. It seems like pyuvsim doesn't allow one antenna only (check Aaron's repo for his force).


(3) Should be easy to read ULSA skymodel to pyuvdata like vis_cpu suggests (each NPIX is just a source on the sky)


(4) Need really to be able to convert E-field beams to uvdata. Tests for Anze.
