(3) Best to just finish notebook pipeline first maybe.


(1) Need to figure out layout.csv and uvbeam.yaml files in sim_files. It seems like pyuvsim doesn't allow one antenna only (check Aaron's repo for his force).
UPDATE: it seems like the uvdata_select should work fine. Just add a throwout antenna and select the autocorrelation of our beam. TEST: that the throwaway antenna indeed does not matter for the results of the autocorrelation (would be very weird if it did...)


(2) Should be easy to read ULSA skymodel to pyuvdata like vis_cpu suggests (each NPIX is just a source on the sky)


(4) Need really to be able to convert E-field beams to uvdata. Tests for Anze.
