(1) Best to just finish notebook pipeline first.


(2) Should be easy to read ULSA skymodel to pyuvdata like vis_cpu suggests (each NPIX is just a source on the sky)


(3) Need to figure out layout.csv and uvbeam.yaml files in sim_files. It seems like pyuvsim doesn't allow one antenna only (check Aaron's repo for his force).
UPDATE: it seems like the uvdata_select should work fine. Just add a throwout antenna and select the autocorrelation of our beam. TEST: that the throwaway antenna indeed does not matter for the results of the autocorrelation (would be very weird if it did...)

(4) Understand E_z and the conditon that E dot r = 0 in the farfield (dipole
radiation). It looks like the condition isn't satisfied for these antenna sims.

(5) Do some 21-cm simulations

(6) Tests for Anze.
